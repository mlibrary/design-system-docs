Creating a flyer, video tutorial, slides, or something else where you need to make font, color, or other design choices?

Use our [visual elements](/visual-elements/) to pick from a set of established, accessible options, as well as guidance for using images.

**Need the logo?** [Here you go](/visual-elements/logo/).

And donâ€™t forget we have [Document and Slide templates](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uIDCY-OIyd2cET3PkpZVOco32wGKsM91?usp=sharing).

Our slide templates are designed to be accessible for all users. We provide a light, medium, and dark theme to accommodate different user needs while still meeting WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.
