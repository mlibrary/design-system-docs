# {{ title }}

When you write something as part of your job at the U-M Library, you’re writing on behalf of our organization.

The Design System has tons of support for creating content and writing effectively.

In addition to making sure you’re capturing our [voice and tone](/content/voice-and-tone/), you can:

* Check out [writing about the library](/content/writing-about-the-library/) to find out what we call our many selves.  
* Learn about our approach to [writing for people](/content/writing-for-people/) — we love the [Hemingway app](https://hemingwayapp.com/) for real-time feedback on readability.
* Learn how to [write about people](/content/writing-about-people/) with care.
* Refer to our [grammar and style guidance](/content/grammar-and-style/) for our stance on the Oxford comma, the presentation of lists, and much more.  
* Use the [word list](/content/word-list/) for help with things like whether to use pickup or pick up.
