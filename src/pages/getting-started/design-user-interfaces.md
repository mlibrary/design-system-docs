# {{ title }}

If you are designing a U-M Library branded interface, we provide the assets and associated guidance to get you started.

Our [visual elements](/visual-elements/) include color, typography, and icons, as well as support for using images and the U-M Library logo.

[Reusable designs](/reusable-designs/) are the heart of the Design System and aim to provide the building blocks for designing your interface.

## Figma UI Toolkit

Our team uses [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)  in our design work.

[Best practices for scaled design in Figma](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16SJAFx2EepnSY6xLau8ZEBw6b1Ez1flkim0jP2VXBIs/edit?usp=sharing) is a good place to start if you are new to designing in Figma or would like some guidance and insight into how members of the Design System Team use the tools.

The [Figma UI Toolkit](https://www.figma.com/@mlibrary) contains the styles and components that make up our visual elements and reusable designs. These assets will help you create designs and prototypes.
