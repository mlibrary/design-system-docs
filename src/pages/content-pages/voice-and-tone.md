# {{ title }}

The University of Michigan Library voice is clear and helpful with a welcoming tone.

We focus on the experiences of people who use our services and spaces — and prioritize helping people find, access, and use what they need to get their work done. 

Our voice is not pompous or self-congratulatory. It doesn't focus on the library’s organizational structure or its achievements. For example, "Further your research by…" rather than "We are a world leader in…."

## Clear

Information should be clear and understandable, so it’s easier for everyone to comprehend, including people in a hurry.

* Use plain language.
* Do not use jargon or buzzwords.
* Opt for simple sentences with shorter words over formal, more complex ones.
* Opt for short paragraphs for readability.

## Helpful

Patrons generally come to our website or other library products to complete a certain task or get specific information.

* Describe only what’s needed.
* Leave out nonessential details.
* Direct people to appropriate resources at time of need.

{% callout "info" %}
Don't presume that something is “fast” or “easy” — people execute information and instructions in different ways. Rather than, “It’s a quick 10-minute survey,” write “The survey has 5 multiple-choice questions.”
{% endcallout %}

## Welcoming

A welcoming tone encourages people to explore and ask questions. 

* Write conversationally. Be human (contractions are your friend), and use an [active voice](/content/writing-for-people/#use-active-voice).  
* Consider who will read your content, why they’ll read it, and where they’ll read it.  
* Avoid specialist terms and acronyms, unless you tell users what they mean in plain language.
