# {{ title }}

We encourage including the U-M Library’s Territorial Acknowledgement on associated websites, slide presentations, and other materials.

When using the acknowledgement, it is important to provide access to the entire section of information on our website. It includes a brief version of the acknowledgement and the full acknowledgement in both Anishinaabemowin and English, plus resources and further reading.

There are three options to choose from depending on the context and how much space you have available. Always use one of the “with URL” options when the acknowledgement will be on a slide, in print, or anywhere else the user isn't able to directly select a link.

## Brief version with URL

This is the **preferred version**. Use it in slides or any other time you have space for a paragraph and supplementary sentence.

> The Bodewadmi, the Odawa, and the Ojibwe, collectively named the Anishinaabe, lived in the lands and the waterways of the Michigami before the first white settlers arrived here. They continue to live here still, and the University of Michigan owes its creation to them. The University of Michigan Library is deeply indebted to the Wyandot and Anishinaabe Peoples, and we still have much work to do in order to honor the intent and spirit of the treaty upon which we were founded.

>*Find our full territorial acknowledgement in Anishinaabemowin and English, along with resources and further reading, at [lib.umich.edu/acknowledgement](http://lib.umich.edu/acknowledgement).*

## Sentence with URL

Use when you want to share the acknowledgement and only have space for a sentence.

> Read our territorial acknowledgement in Anishinaabemowin or English at [lib.umich.edu/acknowledgement](http://lib.umich.edu/acknowledgement).  

## Linked text only

Use for a direct link, such as in a website footer.
