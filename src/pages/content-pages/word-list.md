# {{ title }}

## Alumni

Use "alumni," the more gender-inclusive term, when referring to a group of graduates. "Alum" is an accepted informal alternative.

[Avoid the binary](/content/writing-about-people/#non-binary-language) and more confusing designations you might occasionally encounter across campus: "Alumnus," (*alumni* as the plural), which was traditionally used to refer to a group of male graduates, and "alumna" (*alumnae* as the plural), traditionally used to refer to female graduates.

## Anti-racist, anti-racism

The library’s current style choice is to include the hyphen when referring to anti-racism or anti-racist, as both an adjective and a noun.

## B.C.E.

See [C.E. and B.C.E.](https://design-system.lib.umich.edu/content/word-list/#ce-and-bce)

## Birds of America, The

We frequently reference the fact that the U-M Library marks its formal beginning with the purchase of John James Audubon’s *The Birds of America*.

“The” is part of the official title.

## C.E. and B.C.E.

Use C.E. (common era) and B.C.E. (before the common era) rather than A.D. and B.C.

## e.g.

Avoid this Latin abbreviation in web writing and with other formal communication. Spell out "for example" instead.

See also [i.e.](/content/word-list/#ie)

## Google

If you aren't specifically referring to Google, use the generic "search engine," “search,” or "searching the internet."

Google is a registered trademark, so, if you are actually referring to the specific search engine, capitalize terms like Google, Googling, Googled.

## i.e.

Avoid this Latin abbreviation in web writing and with other formal communication. Spell out "that is" or "in other words."

See also [e.g.](/content/word-list/#eg)

## Interlibrary loan

Spell out interlibrary loan and use lowercase.

If written as "ILL," screen readers will read it as the word, "ill."

For more information, see our [guidance on avoiding acronyms](/content/grammar-and-style/#acronyms-and-abbreviations).

## LibGuides

In public-facing materials, don't use the term LibGuides. Refer to them as research guides.

## Live stream, live streaming

For events that are streamed live, you can use "live stream," "live streaming," "streamed live," "streaming live," "streaming online," and so on.

Avoid "Livestream," as it is the formal name of a registered company — unless you are referring to that company.

## Log in, login

When used as a verb, use **log in**: *Please log in to the module.*

When used as a noun, use **login**: *What's my login?*

Neither form is hyphenated.

We prefer **U-M credentials** to **U-M login** in cases where you need to sign in with your U-M information: *You'll be prompted to log in with your U-M credentials.*

## Mcard, MCommunity

The "C" in these U-M proper names is capitalized. This was not the case for MCard before 2025. 

* The **MCard** is your official University of Michigan identification card.
* **MCommunity** is a public and enterprise directory of all people and groups at U-M.

## MLibrary

Do not use. 

See [our identity](/content/writing-about-the-library/) for agreed upon names and styles for referring to the library.

## Online and technology terms, general

Use these spellings:

* blog  
* cellphone  
* download  
* ebook  
* email  
* internet  
* intranet  
* online  
* smartphone  
* web  
* web page  
* website  
* webcam  
* webmaster  
* Facebook  
* Google, Googling, Googled  
* Twitter, tweet, tweeted, retweet  
* YouTube  
* Zoom

## Pick up, pickup

When used as a noun or adjective, use **pickup**: Shapiro Library is a pickup location.

When used as a verb, use **pick up**: *You can go to* Shapiro to pick up your books.

Neither form is hyphenated.

## Reference Reading Room, reading room

Capitalize when referencing the reading room on the second floor of Hatcher Library.

If you're referring to a reading room more generally, keep it lowercase and provide information about the location.

## Slave

Do not use.

Instead use "enslaved person," "enslaved people," or "people who were enslaved."  

Being enslaved is something that happens to people or has happened; it is not an identity.

## Wireless, Wi-Fi

We refer to [wireless networks](https://www.lib.umich.edu/visit-and-study/computing-and-technology/computing), wireless internet, or wireless access. Wi-Fi is a registered trademark, so don't use lowercase as in wi-fi.
