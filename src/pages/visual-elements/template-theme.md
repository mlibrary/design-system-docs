# {{ title }}

If you’re creating content for your work at the library within the Google Workspace or PowerPoint, we have templates, ready-made themes, and guidelines that provide a starting point for creating accessible materials that follow our brand and style. 

See our public Drive folder of [Themes, Templates, and Guidelines](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uIDCY-OIyd2cET3PkpZVOco32wGKsM91?usp=share_link). It is organized into subfolders by product.

## What we provide

All of our themes and templates are branded with U-M Library colors and fonts. We aim to exemplify best practices for accessibility, readability, and human centered design.

You can:

* Make a copy of our **Google Docs** template with built-in guidance and default styles.  
* Read our **Google Form** theme guidelines for instructions on setting a branded theme.  
* View our sample **Google Site** and accompanying guidelines for basic theming support and content creation guidance.  
* Use one of three **Google Slide** theme templates or our PowerPoint template with a range of layout options.

Within the Google Slide and PowerPoint template folders, you’ll find a README file with directions for how to use them in your file (either starting new or adding to an existing one). 

## Other suggestions?

If there are other products that you think would benefit from themes, templates, or design guidance, please [contact the Design System Team](/about/get-in-touch/).
