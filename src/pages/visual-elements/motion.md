# {{ Motion }}

Motion — micro-interactions and animations — can bring design elements to life and guide users through a digital experience. Micro-interactions ensure seamless and delightful usability for specific actions, while animations add to the tone and feel of the interface.
There are important factors to consider in your implementation of any motion in a user interface. Movement can cause dizziness and nausea for users with vestibular disorders and distract users with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, causing them to lose track of their focus. You have to use motion thoughtfully and strategically and it must not harm or distract users. 
Anyone who wants to add motion should directly contact the [Design System team](/about/our-team/) for help.
