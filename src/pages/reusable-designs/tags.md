Tags are selectable elements displaying keywords that categorize or classify content.

## When to use tags

Use tags for displaying keywords representing categories that users can select as options, as well as to navigate through content or filter results.

Do not use tags as links that direct you to an entirely different page or launch you outside the current website or application.

For non-interactive labels to communicate numerical values, statuses, achievements, or other similar quantifying or qualifying information, use [badges](/reusable-designs/badges/).

## Tag types and states

**Types:**

* Text only  
* Text and icon  
* Dismissible

**States:**

* Default  
* Hover  
* Selected
* Disabled

## Guidelines for using tags

* Keep tag labels concise. We recommend labels with a maximum of 50 characters and ideally, less than 25\.  
* Use tags in moderation to not overwhelm users with choices.
* Be cautious if tags might appear in the same area of the page as buttons and cause confusion. Similarly, avoid mixing tags and badges.  
* Use horizontal alignment when there are only a few tags. If tags run past a single line, they should wrap and form another line.
