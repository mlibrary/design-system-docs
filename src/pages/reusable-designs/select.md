Select uses the browser or operating system default to display a dropdown menu of options.

## When to use Select

Use select for dropdowns that are part of form submissions, such as modifying a search or submitting a request.

Select can also be used instead of a dropdown to allow users to select a single item from a list with at least 4 options.

### Other input options

To allow **multi-select** from a list of options, use [checkboxes](/reusable-designs/checkbox/). For **shorter lists of single-select options**, use [radio buttons](/reusable-designs/radio-button/) to display them all on the page.

If you want to be able to **use custom styles, or present options to modify content on a page** (such as sorting), use a dropdown.

## Select elements

* **Label**: clearly explains the content of the menu  
* **Menu**: contains the list of all selectable items

## Guidelines for providing options

Avoid overwhelming people with too many choices in the **list of options**. They should be presented in a logical order â€” alphabetical, numerical, chronological, most commonly selected first, or something else clear.

For **option labels**, use clear and concise language written in sentence case.

Be sure to include input validation as appropriate.
