CKEditor Accordions - Detail Plugin
===================================

Description
===========
Accordions are a popular way to structure content. In the past nested divs or
definition lists were augmented by JavaScript to provide this functionality,
but the HTML5 details element provides this functionality natively. This module
adds a button so editors can easily use this element in their content.

Usage
=====
Go to the Text formats and editors settings (/admin/config/content/formats) and
add the Details button to any CKEditor-enabled text format you want.

Installation
============
1. Enable CKEditor Accordions - Detail Plugin module in the Drupal admin.

Each filter format will now have a config tab for this plugin.

Dependencies
============
This module requires the core CKEditor module.

Uninstallation
==============
1. Uninstall the module from 'Administer >> Modules'.
